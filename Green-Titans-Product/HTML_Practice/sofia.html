  <h2> Part 1 : Beginning of Time </h2>
  <p> <img src = "IMAGES/prehistoricMinions.jpeg" alt "Cave Minions" width = "400"> <br>
    Our story begins <em>3.8 billion years ago</em>, when Minions first came into existence. Being the hardworking souls that they are, they began their quest for a boss to serve.
    <br>
    Between 70 million years ago and 2500 BCE they served a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a caveman, and a Pharaoh. Unfortunately for those guys, they were all killed in the process.

  <h2> Part 3: 1960s </h2>
  <p> <img src = "IMAGES/minionsBobIsKing.jpeg" alt "Bob = King" width = "400"><br>
   The 1960s was a fast-changing decade for our beloved Minions. For the vast majority of it they were depressed since they lacked a boss. <i>(Note: if you're ever depressed please don't wait years to seek help like our Minions. Get help ASAP.)</i> However, everything changed in 1968 when Kevin, Stuart, and Bob arrived in New York and successfully became the new henchmen of the Overkills.
<br>
   The Minions had a nice couple of days, and were appointed to steal the crown of Queen Elizabeth II. However, through an accident, Bob became crowned King of England, and Scarlett Overkill turned on the Minions, forcing them to defeat her. They then discovered Felonius Gru (the Gru of the movies) and became his minions.

  <p style = "width:400px"> <img src = "IMAGES/minionsGruWedding.jpeg" alt "Minions+Gru = Family <3" width = "400"><br>
   For the next few decades the Minions work alongside Gru as he become a supervillain and then a superhero, becoming a treasured part of his family. At the very end of the third Despicable Me movie, the minions go off with Gru's brother, Dru, to start a new adventure.
