<h1>
  Under The Bridge
</h1>

<p id = p1>
   The song Under The Bridge was written by the legendary 80's rock band, Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song represents a very dark time in the lead singers, Anthony Kiedis, life. He embraces the city as his friend, as he feels that he is alone and isolated because of some of his prior life mistakes. During the chorus of the song, he talks about how bad he felt when he was doing those messed up things, and how he never wants to sin like that again.
