<h1>Neural Networks</h1>

<p><strong>History/Overview</strong> 📖🖊️</p>

<p1>&nbsp;Neural Network is a method to teach A.I. to process information in a manner that is similar to the human mind. The idea of Neural Networks started out as a model of neurons and how the brain works. “ Donald Hebb took the idea further in his book, The Organization of Behavior (1949), proposing that neural pathways strengthen over each successive use, especially between neurons that tend to fire at the same time thus beginning the long journey towards quantifying the complex processes of the brain.”

<p2><strong>&nbsp;How It Works</strong>💻🌿</p2>
<br>
<br> 
<p3>&nbsp;A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain</p3>

<p4><strong>Pros</strong> ✅😁</p4>
<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
  
<li>A model that can accurately represent and connect with a human.</li>
<li>Are flexible and can be used for regression and classification</li>
<li>Neural networks are good to model with nonlinear data with large number of inputs</li>  
<li>Once trained it can become really fast</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p5><strong>Cons</strong>❌😞</p5>
<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li>Neural networks are black boxes, meaning we cannot know how much each independent variable is influencing the dependent variables.</li>
<li>It is computationally very expensive and time consuming to train with traditional CPUs.</li>
<li>Neural networks depend a lot on training data.</li>
